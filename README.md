## Course plan

The course consists of weekly meetings every (TBD, Friday?) at (TBD, 13.15?). 
During the weekly meetings we will have discussions over common material. 
Here's a tentative plan:

* Session 1: Introduction to NbE for simply typed and untyped lambda calculi
* Session 2: NbE implementation techniques + Different flavors of normalization
* Session 3: NbE semantics + Extensions of NbE (for sums, dependent types, System F, etc.)

Every participant is expected to give a presentation on the chosen papers 
at the end of the course, on the 28th of November (at [ITC](https://github.com/InitialTypes/Club/wiki)).

More details on the presentation to follow.

## Examination

Examiner: [Andreas Abel](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~abela/)

Credits: 4, but the final decision about how many credits the course gives rests with each participantâ€™s respective examiner.

Full participation in the course entails:

- [ ] Attending a majority of the discussion sessions.
- [ ] Giving a presentation based on the chosen papers.
- [ ] Writing a survey paper based on the chosen papers.
