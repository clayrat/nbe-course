# NbE @ Chalmers

Course on Normalization by Evaluation (NbE) at the Chalmers CSE department, in principle for PhD students, but also open for Master students.

## Course plan

The course will take place during 2019 LP1/2 starting 28th October until end of LP2. The proposed structure is three course meetings and a final presentation on chosen topics (see below). 

### Course meetings

The meetings will take place weekly every Wednesday at 10 am in room (TBD). The goal of these meetings is to facilitate discussions on introductory topics. Here's a tentative schedule:

| Date | Volunteer | Topic | Reading |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30 Oct | _ | Introduction to NbE for the simply-typed lambda calculus | Chapter 2 in [1] and Section 2 (upto 2.4) in [6] |
|  6 Nov | _ | Introduction to NbE for untyped lambda calculus and combinators | Chapter 3 in [1] (untyped lambda calculus), and parts of [7] (untyped combinators) |
| 13 Nov | _ | _ | _ |
| 20 Nov | _ | Proving soundness of NbE | TBD |

### Presentation

Every participant is expected to read at least two papers from the [list of papers](papers.md), and give a presentation on them at the [Initial Types Club](https://github.com/InitialTypes/Club/wiki) meeting on the 28th of November. More details on the presentation to follow later.

## Examination

Examiner: [Andreas Abel](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~abela/)

Credits: 4, but the final decision about how many credits the course gives rests with each participant’s respective examiner.

The course will be examined based on the following criteria:

- [ ] Attending a majority of the discussion sessions.
- [ ] Giving a presentation based on the chosen papers.
- [ ] Writing a survey article based on the chosen papers.
