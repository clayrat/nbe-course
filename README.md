# NbE @ Chalmers

Course on [Normalization by Evaluation (NbE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalisation_by_evaluation) at the Chalmers CSE department. In principle for PhD students, but also open for Master students. The course will take place during 2019 LP1/2 starting 28th October until end of LP2.

## Course plan

This will be primarily a reading course. Every participant is expected to study at least two papers from the [list of papers](papers.md), and give a presentation on them in the end. The participant is also expected to write a short survey article summarizing the chosen papers.

We will have three course meetings; the goal of which is to facilitate discussion on introductory topics. The meetings will help us establish familiarity of general NbE vocabulary and techniques, and hence aid studying the papers (which often have a specific technical focus).


## Examination

Examiner: [Andreas Abel](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~abela/)

The course will be assessed in three parts:

- [ ] Attending a majority of the course meetings.
- [ ] Giving a presentation based on the chosen papers.
- [ ] Writing a survey article based on the chosen papers.

Credits: 4, but the final decision about how many credits the course gives rests with each participant’s respective examiner. Please
