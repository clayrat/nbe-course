# NbE @ Chalmers

Course on Normalization by Evaluation at the Chalmers CSE department, in principle for PhD students.

## Course plan

The course will take place during 2019 LP2 - LP3 starting 24th October until end of November. The proposed structure is three course meetings and a final presentation on chosen topics (see below). 

### Course meetings

The meetings will take place weekly every Friday in room (TBD), starting 25th October. The goal of these meetings is to facilitate discussions on introductory topics. Here's a tentative schedule:

* Meeting 1 (25/10, 13:15): Introduction to NbE for simply-typed lambda calculus
  - Reading: Chapter 2 in [1] and Section 2 (upto 2.4) in [6]
* Meeting 2 (1/11, 13:15): Introduction to NbE for untyped lambda calculus and untyped combinators
  - Reading: Chapter 3 in [1] (untyped lambda calculus), and parts of [7] (untyped combinators)
* Meeting 3 (8/11, 10:00): Proving soundness of NbE
  - Reading: TBD

### Presentation

Every participant is expected to read atleast two papers from the [list of papers](papers.md), and give a presentation on them at the [Initial Types Club](https://github.com/InitialTypes/Club/wiki) meeting on the 28th of November. More details on the presentation to follow later.

## Examination

Examiner: [Andreas Abel](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~abela/)

Credits: 4, but the final decision about how many credits the course gives rests with each participant’s respective examiner.

Full participation in the course entails:

- [ ] Attending a majority of the discussion sessions.
- [ ] Giving a presentation based on the chosen papers.
- [ ] Writing a survey article based on the chosen papers.
