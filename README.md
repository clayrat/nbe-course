## Course plan

The course consists of three meetings which will take place weekly every (TBD, Friday?) at (TBD, 13.15?) in room (TBD), starting (TBD, 25th October?). The goal of these meetings is to facilitate discussions on introductory topics. Here's a tentative plan:

* Meeting 1: Introduction to NbE for simply-typed and untyped lambda calculi
* Meeting 2: NbE implementation techniques (Kripke-style vs "gensym") + Different flavors of normalization (WHNF, without eta rules, etc.)
* Meeting 3: NbE semantics + Extensions of NbE (for sums, dependent types, System F, etc.)

Every participant is expected to read atleast two papers from the [list of papers](papers.md), and give a presentation on them at the [ITC](https://github.com/InitialTypes/Club/wiki) meeting on the 28th of November.

More details on the presentation to follow.

## Examination

Examiner: [Andreas Abel](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~abela/)

Credits: 4, but the final decision about how many credits the course gives rests with each participantâ€™s respective examiner.

Full participation in the course entails:

- [ ] Attending a majority of the discussion sessions.
- [ ] Giving a presentation based on the chosen papers.
- [ ] Writing a survey article based on the chosen papers.
